# README - Michael Haag's Repository 



## Welcome to my public repository!

In the folder named **"Data Science"** you will find some of the projects I completed during my data science bootcamp at SPICED ACADEMY.<br>
Additionally, I may add some data science projects I did on my own over the last few months to this folder in the near future.<br> You can find a short description of each project in the respective subfolders. 
 
In the folder named **"Math"** you can find various Python scripts relating to my inquiries into mathematics. A significant part of those scripts are based on the textbook: Weitz,Edmund: "Konkrete Mathematik (nicht nur) f√ºr Informatiker", Berlin 2021  

Please note that this repository is currently **a work in progress**.
