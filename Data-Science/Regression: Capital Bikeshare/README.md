# Regression - The Capital Bikeshare Dataset (Kaggle)

The goal of this project was to **build and train a regression model** on the Capital Bike Share (Washington, D.C.) Kaggle data set, in order to predict demand for bicycle rentals at any given hour, based on time and weather, e.g.:

“Given the forecasted weather conditions, how many bicycles can we expect to be rented out (city-wide) this Saturday at 2pm?”
